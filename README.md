# Rcodingclub66: Introduction

The **Rcodingclub66** is a group of students and researchers, mainly in the field of ecology and connected to Perpignan, France.     
The goal of this coding club is to learn from eachother and further develop our R skills as scientists.
The idea is to meet once every two weeks for an hour or two on Tuesday afternoon (16h).   
Each meeting another member leads the session, but idea is really to work and discuss together.

## Organisation of sessions

1) **Short introduction of the session**     
A member gives a small introduction on the topic of the week (20min max).    
2) **Tutorial**   
We collectively follow a tutorial on our computers and discuss issues that may arise    
3) **Package discovery time**   
Each session, all members think of any fun/useful packages they know or discovered and briefly explain
4) **Open discussion**    
This is the moment where anyone can present a specific isssue or question they may have on R and the rest of the group tries to troubleshoot. Topics can be R or stats related.
